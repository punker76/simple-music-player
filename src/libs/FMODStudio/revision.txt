===============================================================================

09/02/17 1.09.01 - Studio API major release (build 84153)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* LowLevel API - Added FMOD_DSP_STATE_FUNCTIONS::getlistenerattributes to the
                 DSP plugin API to query the current listener attributes.
* Unity        - Added support for Rigidbody2D in 3D attribute settings and 
                 integration scripts.
* Unity        - Added support for Object Enable/Disable on EventEmitter and 
                 ParameterTrigger scripts.
* UE4          - Added GetLength function for blueprints that returns the event length 
                 in milliseconds.
* UE4          - Improved in editor profiling stats.

Fixes:
* Unity        - Fixed compatibility with Unity 4.6 & 4.7 for OSX and IOS.
* Unity        - Fixed "file not found" error when settings asset is corrupt
* Unity        - Fixed set3DAttributes ambiguity.
* Unity        - Fixed not being able to copy ReadOnly banks into StreamingAssets.
* Unity        - Fixed event instance leak in Unity PlayOneshotAttached not releasing.
* Unity        - Specified version to check for WiiU BuildTarget for early Unity5.
* UE4          - Fixed XboxOne delayload error now that UE4 handles it.
* UE4          - Android - Added ARM64 support.
* Studio API   - AHDSR modulator curve shapes now work correctly. In previous versions 
                 the envelope was interpolated linearly regardless of the shape displayed
                 in the UI.
* Studio API   - Fixed looping single sounds in an async multi sound being cut-off when
                 the multi sound is un-triggered.                  
* LowLevel API - Fixed Channel::setReverbProperties not resetting reverb connection
                 to a new tail DSP when turning wet mix off and on.
* LowLevel API - If the system is initialized in right-handed mode, FMOD will now swap
                 to left-handed when passing attributes into plugins. This only applies
                 to plugins rebuilt against this version, old plugins remain unswapped.
* LowLevel API - Fix MOD/S3M/XM/IT file crash with samples that have 0 length.
* LowLevel API - Fixed some potential crashes when running out of memory, these will
                 correctly return FMOD_ERR_MEMORY now.
* LowLevel API - Win - Fixed WASAPI recording device enumeration taking a couple of seconds
                 after System::init before being correct.
* LowLevel API - Win - Fixed potential error returned from System::update if device is unplugged.
* LowLevel API - MIDI - Fixed Sound::set/getMusicChannelVolume referring to wrong track 
                 indices rather than just a normal 0-15 track index.
* LowLevel API - MIDI - Fixed Channel::setPosition causing loud drum bang noise after seek

Notes:
* Studio API   - When loading legacy banks with looping sounds nested in multi sounds, 
                 the multi sound is set to cut-off all sounds when untriggered, including
                 non-looping sounds. This is a change in behaviour compared to earlier 
                 versions where only looping sounds were cut-off.  
* LowLevel API - DSP plugin API version has been increased, for maximum compatibility
                 plugin writers should only rebuild against this version if they need
                 the getlistenerattributes feature. Old plugins are still supported.

01/12/16 1.09.00 - Studio API major release (build 82164)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Studio API   - Added support for multiple listener weights, with
                 Studio::System::setListenerWeight and
                 Studio::System::getListenerWeight.  This allows listeners to be
                 faded in or out smoothly.
* Studio API   - Profiling uses less CPU and memory.
* Studio API   - Added FMOD_STUDIO_INIT_LOAD_FROM_UPDATE to drive all loading from
                 Studio::System::update rather than the bank and resource loading
                 threads.  Mainly used in non-realtime situations.
* Studio API   - Added ability to run replays at faster than real time speed using
                 FMOD_STUDIO_COMMANDREPLAY_FAST_FORWARD.
* Studio API   - Added Studio::EventInstance::setReverbLevel and
                 Studio::EventInstance::getReverbLevel.
* Studio API   - Support for automation of modulator properties.
* LowLevel API - Improved memory use when loading sounds with names.
* LowLevel API - Added new efficient multiband equalizer (FMOD_DSP_TYPE_MULTIBAND_EQ)
                 featuring 5 toggleable bands with variable rolloff low/high pass, shelf,
                 peaking, band-pass, all-pass and notch modes.
* LowLevel API - Added logging function to the DSP plugin API. Use FMOD_DSP_LOG
                 helper macro from a DSP callback.
* LowLevel API - Added FMOD_DSP_STATE_FUNCTIONS::getuserdata to the DSP plugin API.
                 Use FMOD_DSP_GETUSERDATA helper macro from a DSP callback.
* FSBank API   - Added ability to pass NULL as the FSB file name for FSBank_Build causing
                 the FSB to be built in memory. Use FSBank_FetchFSBMemory to get access
                 to the data once the build has completed. 

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed incorrect playback volume for instruments and playlist
                 items whose volume property is set to a non-zero dB value.

Notes:
* LowLevel API - Incremented Plugin SDK version for DSP plugins. Dynamic library
                 plugins built with earlier versions will continue to load.
* LowLevel API - Incremented FMOD_CODEC_WAVEFORMAT version.  Codecs that provide
                 names must keep the name memory persistent for the lifetime
                 of the codec.
* LowLevel API - Increment Plugin API version for Output plugins. Dynamic library 
                 Output Plugins must be rebuilt.
* LowLevel API - FMOD_DSP_TYPE_LOWPASS, FMOD_DSP_TYPE_LOWPASS_SIMPLE,
                 FMOD_DSP_TYPE_HIGHPASS, FMOD_DSP_TYPE_HIGHPASS_SIMPLE and
                 FMOD_DSP_TYPE_PARAMEQ are considered deprecated and will be removed
                 in the future. Use the new FMOD_DSP_TYPE_MULTIBAND_EQ instead which
                 has the performance of "simple" effects with full featured quality.
* LowLevel API - Changed reverb wet mix to send from the fader DSP of a ChannelGroup.
                 Previously it sent from the head DSP. Now effects placed pre-fader
                 will apply to the signal sent to the reverb, while effects placed
                 post-fader will not.
* LowLevel API - ChannelGroup reverb wet level is now scaled by the group's
                 effective audibility.
* LowLevel API - ChannelGroup reverb no longer automatically disables reverb
                 on its child channels when the wet level is set to non-zero.
* LowLevel API - Channel::setReverbProperties now allows setting the wet level
                 before the specified reverb instance has been created.
* LowLevel API - ChannelControl::addDSP and ChannelControl::removeDSP manage
                 standard DSP connections (FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_STANDARD)
                 to maintain the mixer hierarchy.
                 Other connection types (FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SIDECHAIN,
                 FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SEND_SIDECHAIN, and now
                 FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SEND) are left undisturbed.
* LowLevel API - FMOD_INIT_MIX_FROM_UPDATE will now directly execute the mixer from
                 System::update instead of triggering the mix to happen in another
                 thread.
* Studio API   - Incremented bank version, requires runtime 1.09.00 or later.
* Studio API   - Latest runtime supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.
* Studio API   - Studio::Bus::setFaderLevel, Studio::Bus::getFaderLevel,
                 Studio::VCA::setFaderLevel and Studio::VCA::getFaderLevel is now 
                 called Studio::Bus::setVolume, Studio::Bus::getVolume,
                 Studio::VCA::setVolume and Studio::VCA::getVolume. 
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::getVolume, 
                 Studio::EventInstance::getPitch,
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValue,
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValueByIndex,
                 Studio::Bus::getVolume,
                 Studio::VCA::getVolume now have an additional argument
                 to get the final value which includes automation and modulation.
* Studio API   - The required alignment for Studio::System::loadBankMemory has
                 been added as the constant FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_MEMORY_ALIGNMENT.
* Studio API   - Event instances now disable reverb on their internal channels,
                 for all global reverb instances. Previously only did so for
                 reverb instance 0. Use Studio::EventInstance::setReverbLevel
                 to control the reverb mix for the whole event instance.
* Studio API   - Disconnected sidechain modulators are now inactive. Previous
                 behavior was to fall back to monitoring the event's master
                 track output.
* LowLevel API - FMOD_DSP_RELEASE_CALLBACK is now called from the main thread
* LowLevel API - Unimplemented ChannelControl::overridePanDSP function has been
                 removed, along with FMOD_CHANNELCONTROL_DSP_PANNER enum value.
* LowLevel API - PS3 - Removed old opt-in FIOS support via FMOD_PS3_EXTRADRIVERDATA.
                       New recommended approach is to use FMOD_FILE_ASYNCREAD_CALLBACK
                       and set appropriate deadlines based on FMOD_ASYNCREADINFO::priority.
* LowLevel API - Xbox One - Optimized XMA decoding performance and removed the ACP thread.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - Improved AT9 decoding performance.
* FSBank API - Added support for source data as a memory pointer instead of file name.
* Documentation - Some FMOD_DSP_PAN_SURROUND enums changed to FMOD_DSP_PAN_2D for clarity.

14/07/16 1.08.08 - Studio API minor release (build 77846)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* UE4          - bMatchHardwareSampleRate will use the system default format
                 to avoid excessively matching the output rate on mobile devices.
* UE4          - Added bLockAllBuses which will force all buses to be created
                 at startup, rather than on demand.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed looping sounds in a multi sound playlist failing to stop
                 if the multi sound itself is non-looping.
* Studio API   - Fixed rare crash calling the following functions while the 
                 bank containing the event is unloading:

* Studio API   - Fixed shared events becoming invalidated when one of the
                 banks containing them is unloaded. Could also manifest as
                 Studio::EventInstance::getDescription failing with
                 FMOD_ERR_INTERNAL.
* Studio API   - Fixed crash that could occur when using 
                 FMOD_STUDIO_INIT_SYNCHRONOUS_UPDATE and calling 
                 Studio::System::update from multiple threads at the same time.
* Studio API   - Increased scheduling lookahead time to ensure sample accurate
                 timeline scheduling even if there is an output stall.
* Studio API   - Fixed crash that could occur when improperly calling 
                 Studio::Bus::getChannelGroup without first calling
                 Studio::Bus::lockChannelGroup, if the bus was being destroyed
                 as the call was made.
* Studio API   - Fixed rare crash calling the following functions while the 
                 master bank containing the bus or VCA is unloading:
                 Studio::System::getBus,
                 Studio::System::getBusByID,
                 Studio::System::getVCA and
                 Studio::System::getVCAByID.
* Studio API   - Fixed rare timing issue where Studio::System::getEvent would
                 succeed but Studio::EventDescription::createInstance would
                 fail with FMOD_ERR_INTERNAL, if called just as the bank
                 containing the event finished loading.
* Studio API   - Fixed rare hang in Studio::System::getBankCount when called
                 while banks are currently unloading.
* LowLevel API - Fixed rare glitch at the start of XMA playback causing non-seamless
                 looping.

                 which means by the runtime memory use might be slightly higher
                 when loading banks exported from 1.08.03 and later.  If this is 
                 a problem, make sure to disable the option to export sound names 
                 in FMOD Studio when re-exporting banks.

                 Studio::EventDescription::hasCue and Studio::EventInstance::triggerCue.
* Studio API   - Deprecated Studio::EventInstance::getParameter and 
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterByIndex.  Instead use 
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValue,
                 Studio::EventInstance::setParameterValue,
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValueByIndex, and
                 Studio::EventInstance::setParameterValueByIndex.

                  FMOD_DSP_CHANNELMIX_OUTPUT_DEFAULT ... FMOD_DSP_CHANNELMIX_OUTPUT_ALLLFE
                  (ie CHANNELGAIN renamed to CHANNELMIX) to fit with the correct naming 
                  convention. Rename required if using this effect.

                 gain levels for up to 32 input channel signals, and pipe the
                 output to a range of speaker formats i.e. repeating mono,
                 stereo, quad, 5.1, 7.1 or only LFE out.
* LowLevel API - Improved CPU performance when using metering or profiling.
* LowLevel API - Added support for loading multi-channel FSBs with the
                 FMOD_CREATECOMPRESSEDSAMPLE flag.
* LowLevel API - Improved record driver enumeration, list is now persistent,

* LowLevel API - iOS - Added support for bitcode.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed the scatterer module's random distance calculation to
                 ensure it is within the limit set in Studio. In previous
                 versions the random distance may have exceeded the max limit.
                 This change may affect the loudness of sounds with scatterer
                 modules compared to 1.06.xx releases.

Notes:
* Studio API   - Incremented bank version, requires runtime 1.07.00 or later.
* Studio API   - Latest runtime supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.
* Studio API   - Improved compatibility for plugin effects. Adding extra DSP
                 parameters to an effect no longer breaks bank version
                 compatibility.
* Studio API   - Studio::Bank::getEventCount and Studio::Bank::getEventList only
                 return events directly added to the bank, not implicit events
                 that are included in the bank due to event instrument references.
* Studio API   - The asynchronous command buffer for the Studio API will now
                 grow as necessary, avoiding stalls that could occur if it was too
                 small. The commandQueueSize field in FMOD_STUDIO_ADVANCEDSETTINGS
                 now specifies the initial size of the buffer.
* Studio API   - Studio now enables FMOD_INIT_VOL0_BECOMES_VIRTUAL by default.

                 earlier.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - Changed default mix buffer size to 512 samples to reduce
                       CPU cost. Previous setting of 256 can be set using
                       System::setDSPBufferSize.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - The size of each pre-allocated AT9 instance has increased
                       by 8kB.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - Prebuilt static libraries are no longer provided,
                       only dynamic libraries.

                 Studio::System::getListenerAttributes now take a listener
                 index in preparation for multiple listener support.
* Studio API   - Deprecated Studio::ID typedef. Please use FMOD_GUID type.
* Studio API   - Changed FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TYPE from an enum to a
                 bitfield. Added 'callbackmask' parameter to
                 Studio::EventDescription::setCallback and
                 Studio::EventInstance::setCallback.

                 instance is paused and unpaused.
* Lowlevel API - PS3 - Fixed FMOD_PS3_INITFLAGS overlapping FMOD_INITFLAGS causing
                       certain FMOD_INITFLAGS to affect PS3 specific bit-stream
                       encoding options.
* Lowlevel API - PS3 - Fixed a rare hang when releasing a DSP that exposes
                       a FMOD_DSP_PARAMETER_OVERALLGAIN parameter.

                            for lowest latency.
* Studio API   - Fixed virtualized event failing to become real if the number
                 of playing instances drops back below max polyphony.

Notes:
* Lowlevel API - PS3 - Deprecated FMOD_PS3_EXTRADRIVERDATA::initflags. Due to a
                       bug it was being ignored. Pass the flags to System::init instead.

----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Studio API   - Studio::MixerStrip has been replaced by Studio::Bus and Studio::VCA.
                 The new classes do not have a release method, as their handles
                 remain valid until the bank containing them is unloaded.
* Studio API   - Studio::System::getEvent, Studio::System::getBus, Studio::System::getVCA,
                 and Studio::System::getBank now take a string path.
                 Functions that take an ID are now named Studio::System::getEventByID,
                 Studio::System::getBusByID, Studio::System::getVCAByID, and
                 Studio::System::getBankByID.
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::release no longer invalidates the
                 handle immediately. The handle remains valid until the event
                 stops and is actually destroyed. In addition, this function
                 now succeeds even if the event will not stop naturally.
* Studio API   - Events with sounds triggered by parameters will now stop rather
                 than going idle when all sounds have finished and the timeline
                 cursor has reached the end.
* LowLevel API - The wide string argument of System::getDriverInfo() and
                 System::getRecordDriverInfo() has been removed. These functions
                 now return UTF-8 encoded strings.
* LowLevel API - FMOD_UNICODE flag for System::createSound() and System::createStream()
                 has been removed. These functions now accept UTF-8 encoded file names
                 to load sounds with non-ASCII characters on Windows, PS3, PS4, PS Vita,
                 XBox One, iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, Windows Phone, and Windows Store.
* FSBank API   - FSBANK_INIT_UNICODE flag has been removed. All file name structure
                 members and function arguments now accept UTF-8 encoded strings.

Features:
* Studio API   - Added FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_PLUGIN_CREATED and
                 FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_PLUGIN_DESTROYED callback types.

* LowLevel API - Added FMOD::Debug_Initialize to configure the destination and
                 level of debug logging when using the logging version of FMOD.
                 This is a more flexible replacement for the previous
                 FMOD::Debug_SetLevel API.
* LowLevel API - Android - Added support for playing AAC files (requires Android 4.2).
* LowLevel API - Android - Reduced latency for devices that support FastMixer, see
                           "Basic Information" section of the docs CHM for details.
* LowLevel API - Added DSP::setWetDryMix so any effect can have generic wet/dry
                 signal level control.
* LowLevel API - Added 3D ChannelGroup support.  A ChannelGroup is a 'group bus'
                 and it can now be positioned in 3d space, affecting the mix for
                 buses and channels below it.  3D Cones, geometry etc all work.
                 Use ChannelGroup::setMode(FMOD_3D) to enable a 3D ChannelGroup.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed transitions to the end of a loop region failing to escape
                 the loop.
* Studio API   - Fixed sends inside events occasionally having a brief period
                 of full volume when the event is started.

Notes:
* Studio API   - Transition regions no longer include the end of their range.
* Studio API   - FMOD_ERR_EVENT_WONT_STOP has been removed.
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::start now resets all DSPs inside the
                 event to prevent incorrect ramping. This relies on
                 FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK leaving public parameters unchanged.
* Studio API   - Studio::System::getEvent's unimplemented mode parameter has
                 been removed, along with FMOD_STUDIO_LOADING_MODE.
* Studio API   - FMOD_STUDIO_PLAYBACK_IDLE and FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_IDLE
                 have been removed.
* Studio API   - Removed deprecated function Studio::EventInstance::createSubEvent.
* LowLevel API - Changed FMOD_FILE_ASYNCCANCEL_CALLBACK to take FMOD_ASYNCREADINFO
                 structure rather than void *handle.
* LowLevel API - The FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK documentation has been updated to
                 make it clear that it should leave public parameters unchanged.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - Thread affinity can now be set as a mask of allowed cores.
* LowLevel API - iOS / Mac - Reduced default block size to 512 for lower latency.
* LowLevel API - Android - Renamed Java interface from FMODAudioDevice to simply
                           FMOD, i.e. org.fmod.FMOD.init().
* LowLevel API - Channel::setMode moved to ChannelControl::setMode so that
                 ChannelGroups can now also have 2D/3D mode bits set.

* LowLevel API - If a user DSP is added after the master ChannelGroup's fader that
                 changes the output channel count to something other than the
                 software mixer's channel count, stuttering could occur.  Fixed.
* Studio API   - Windows - Fixed Studio API functions deadlocking when in
                 asynchronous mode and a sound device is removed.
* LowLevel API - PS3 - Fixed some DSP parameter sets being ignored
                 (overwritten by SPU DMA)
