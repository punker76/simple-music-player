12/5/20 2.00.09 - Studio API minor release (build 109255)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Core API     - Stadia - Added microphone recording support.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed issue where an instrument not on the timeline would fail to be
                 untriggered while the timeline is inside a source transition region.
* Studio API   - Improve loudness meter performance.
* Studio API   - Fixed issue where the Studio update thread could hang trying to release
                 an event instance where the instance being released used a streaming
                 programmer sound which was reused by another instance and the second
                 instance was still active.
* Studio API   - Fixed issue where scatterer instrument would spawn streaming instruments
                 that would exceed the polyphony limit.
* Studio API   - Fixed scheduling behavior of events inside multi instruments so that the
                 event will play out async instruments, ahdsr modulators and adjust to
                 pitch modulation before playing the next item in the multi instrument.
                 It will still play before DSP tails.

* Unity        - Allow StringHelper to fast return if string is null.

Notes:
* Updated Google VR plugin to version 0.6.1.
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::set3DAttributes and
                 Studio::System::setListenerAttributes will now return
                 FMOD_ERR_INVALID_PARAM if the forward or up vectors are zero. In
                 logging builds warnings will be logged if the forward and up vectors are
                 not orthonormal.
* Core API     - The convolution reverb effect will not accept impulse response data if
                 the system is not using a power-of-two DSP buffer size. Windows Sonic
                 currently requires a DSP buffer size of 480 making it incompatible with
                 convolution reverb until this requirement is lifted.
* PS4          - Now built with SDK 5.008.001.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Core API     - Added FMOD_MAX_SYSTEMS constant, currently 8.
* Core API     - Exposed FMOD_DSP_FADER_GAIN on FMOD_DSP_TYPE_FADER.
* Core API     - Added FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_7POINT1POINT4 speaker mode which includes
                 four height speakers to be used with Windows Sonic output.
* Core API     - Added FMOD_DSP_PAN_2D_HEIGHT_BLEND parameter to FMOD_DSP_TYPE_PAN
                 that allows mixing ground speaker signal into the height speakers
                 and vice versa.
* Core API     - Windows & Xbox One - Added Windows Sonic output plugin to support
                 rendering multichannel (with height) speaker mode 7.1.4 as well
                 as dynamic objects via FMOD_DSP_TYPE_OBJECTPAN.
* Core API     - PS Vita - Switched FMOD_PSVita_SetThreadAffinity to accept a
                 mask instead of a core number to allow floating threads.
* Core API     - Added FMOD_OUTPUT_REQUESTRESET to FMOD_OUTPUT_STATE to allow output
                 plugins to request they be reset by the System.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Sequential multi and scatterer instruments now track their current
                 playlist entry on a per-event-instance basis, rather than globally.
* UE4          - Removed all reference to Oculus, now that Oculus functions as
                 all other FMOD Studio plugins.
* UE4          - Removed all legacy UE4 version code, if you are not using UE4.16
                 the plugin will not work without making changes to source code.
* UE4          - Overhauled details interaction in editor and improved usability.
                 Grouped all FMOD functionality together, added Parameters, and
                 removed unnecessary information from attenuation/occlusion.
* Unity        - Removed garbage allocations from C# wrapper.

Notes:
* Updated Google VR plugin to version 0.6.0.
* Studio API   - Changed the behaviour of nested events to stop when idle even
                 when there are instruments on parameters. This makes nested 
                 events match the behaviour of top level events. Events which
                 depend on the old behaviour need to be manually fixed up by (for
                 example) adding a sustain point to the nested events timeline.
* Core API     - FMOD_DSP_TYPE_ENVELOPEFOLLOWER is now deprecated and will be
                 removed in a future release.
* Core API     - Increment Plugin API version for Output plugins. Dynamic library 
                 Output Plugins must be rebuilt.
* Android      - Logging version will now produce proper crash stacks but due to
                 binary size increase the release version will continue to not.
* Xbox One     - Removed "acp" and "feeder" from FMOD_XBOXONE_THREADAFFINITY.
                 Both threads were removed in previous versions and setting them
                 did nothing.
* UE4          - AudioComponents using occlusion from previous versions are NOT 
                 compatible with this version. Occlusion and Attenuation now do
                 not rely on UE4 structs.

                 in the UI.
* Studio API   - Fixed looping single sounds in an async multi sound being cut-off when
                 the multi sound is un-triggered.

                 to a new tail DSP when turning wet mix off and on.
* Core API     - If the system is initialized in right-handed mode, FMOD will now swap
                 to left-handed when passing attributes into plugins. This only applies
                 to plugins rebuilt against this version, old plugins remain unswapped.
* Core API     - Fix MOD/S3M/XM/IT file crash with samples that have 0 length.
* Core API     - Fixed some potential crashes when running out of memory, these will

                 after System::init before being correct.
* Core API     - Win - Fixed potential error returned from System::update if device is unplugged.
* Core API     - MIDI - Fixed Sound::set/getMusicChannelVolume referring to wrong track 
                 indices rather than just a normal 0-15 track index.

Notes:
* Studio API   - When loading legacy banks with looping sounds nested in multi sounds, 
                 the multi sound is set to cut-off all sounds when untriggered, including
                 non-looping sounds. This is a change in behaviour compared to earlier 
                 versions where only looping sounds were cut-off.  
* Core API     - DSP plugin API version has been increased, for maximum compatibility
                 plugin writers should only rebuild against this version if they need
                 the getlistenerattributes feature. Old plugins are still supported.
* Switch       - Now built with SDK 0.12.10

01/12/16 1.09.00 - Studio API major release (build 82164)
----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Added support for the Nintendo Switch platform.

Features:
* Studio API   - Added support for multiple listener weights, with
                 Studio::System::setListenerWeight and
                 Studio::System::getListenerWeight.  This allows listeners to be
                 faded in or out smoothly.
* Studio API   - Profiling uses less CPU and memory.
* Studio API   - Added FMOD_STUDIO_INIT_LOAD_FROM_UPDATE to drive all loading from
                 Studio::System::update rather than the bank and resource loading
                 threads.  Mainly used in non-realtime situations.
* Studio API   - Added ability to run replays at faster than real time speed using
                 FMOD_STUDIO_COMMANDREPLAY_FAST_FORWARD.
* Studio API   - Added Studio::EventInstance::setReverbLevel and
                 Studio::EventInstance::getReverbLevel.
* Studio API   - Support for automation of modulator properties.
* Core API     - Improved memory use when loading sounds with names.
* Core API     - Added new efficient multiband equalizer (FMOD_DSP_TYPE_MULTIBAND_EQ)
                 featuring 5 toggleable bands with variable rolloff low/high pass, shelf,
                 peaking, band-pass, all-pass and notch modes.
* Core API     - Added logging function to the DSP plugin API. Use FMOD_DSP_LOG
                 helper macro from a DSP callback.
* Core API     - Added FMOD_DSP_STATE_FUNCTIONS::getuserdata to the DSP plugin API.
                 Use FMOD_DSP_GETUSERDATA helper macro from a DSP callback.
* FSBank API   - Added ability to pass NULL as the FSB file name for FSBank_Build causing
                 the FSB to be built in memory. Use FSBank_FetchFSBMemory to get access
                 to the data once the build has completed. 

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed incorrect playback volume for instruments and playlist
                 items whose volume property is set to a non-zero dB value.

Notes:
* Core API     - Incremented Plugin SDK version for DSP plugins. Dynamic library
                 plugins built with earlier versions will continue to load.
* Core API     - Incremented FMOD_CODEC_WAVEFORMAT version.  Codecs that provide
                 names must keep the name memory persistent for the lifetime
                 of the codec.
* Core API     - Increment Plugin API version for Output plugins. Dynamic library 
                 Output Plugins must be rebuilt.
* Core API     - FMOD_DSP_TYPE_LOWPASS, FMOD_DSP_TYPE_LOWPASS_SIMPLE,
                 FMOD_DSP_TYPE_HIGHPASS, FMOD_DSP_TYPE_HIGHPASS_SIMPLE and
                 FMOD_DSP_TYPE_PARAMEQ are considered deprecated and will be removed
                 in the future. Use the new FMOD_DSP_TYPE_MULTIBAND_EQ instead which
                 has the performance of "simple" effects with full featured quality.
* Core API     - Changed reverb wet mix to send from the fader DSP of a ChannelGroup.
                 Previously it sent from the head DSP. Now effects placed pre-fader
                 will apply to the signal sent to the reverb, while effects placed
                 post-fader will not.
* Core API     - ChannelGroup reverb wet level is now scaled by the group's
                 effective audibility.
* Core API     - ChannelGroup reverb no longer automatically disables reverb
                 on its child channels when the wet level is set to non-zero.
* Core API     - Channel::setReverbProperties now allows setting the wet level
                 before the specified reverb instance has been created.
* Core API     - ChannelControl::addDSP and ChannelControl::removeDSP manage
                 standard DSP connections (FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_STANDARD)
                 to maintain the mixer hierarchy.
                 Other connection types (FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SIDECHAIN,
                 FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SEND_SIDECHAIN, and now
                 FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SEND) are left undisturbed.
* Core API     - FMOD_INIT_MIX_FROM_UPDATE will now directly execute the mixer from
                 System::update instead of triggering the mix to happen in another
                 thread.
* Studio API   - Incremented bank version, requires runtime 1.09.00 or later.
* Studio API   - Latest runtime supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.
* Studio API   - Studio::Bus::setFaderLevel, Studio::Bus::getFaderLevel,
                 Studio::VCA::setFaderLevel and Studio::VCA::getFaderLevel is now 
                 called Studio::Bus::setVolume, Studio::Bus::getVolume,
                 Studio::VCA::setVolume and Studio::VCA::getVolume. 
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::getVolume, 
                 Studio::EventInstance::getPitch,
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValue,
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValueByIndex,
                 Studio::Bus::getVolume,
                 Studio::VCA::getVolume now have an additional argument
                 to get the final value which includes automation and modulation.
* Studio API   - The required alignment for Studio::System::loadBankMemory has
                 been added as the constant FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_MEMORY_ALIGNMENT.
* Studio API   - Event instances now disable reverb on their internal channels,
                 for all global reverb instances. Previously only did so for
                 reverb instance 0. Use Studio::EventInstance::setReverbLevel
                 to control the reverb mix for the whole event instance.
* Studio API   - Disconnected sidechain modulators are now inactive. Previous
                 behavior was to fall back to monitoring the event's master
                 track output.
* Core API     - FMOD_DSP_RELEASE_CALLBACK is now called from the main thread
* Core API     - Unimplemented ChannelControl::overridePanDSP function has been
                 removed, along with FMOD_CHANNELCONTROL_DSP_PANNER enum value.
* Core API     - PS3 - Removed old opt-in FIOS support via FMOD_PS3_EXTRADRIVERDATA.
                       New recommended approach is to use FMOD_FILE_ASYNCREAD_CALLBACK
                       and set appropriate deadlines based on FMOD_ASYNCREADINFO::priority.
* Core API     - Xbox One - Optimized XMA decoding performance and removed the ACP thread.
* Core API     - PS4 - Improved AT9 decoding performance.
* FSBank API - Added support for source data as a memory pointer instead of file name.
* Documentation - Some FMOD_DSP_PAN_SURROUND enums changed to FMOD_DSP_PAN_2D for clarity.

                 which means by the runtime memory use might be slightly higher
                 when loading banks exported from 1.08.03 and later.  If this is 
                 a problem, make sure to disable the option to export sound names 
                 in FMOD Studio when re-exporting banks.

* Studio API   - Removed Studio::CueInstance, Studio::EventInstance::getCue, 
                 Studio::EventInstance::getCueCount and
                 Studio::EventInstance::getCueByIndex.  Instead use new functions
                 Studio::EventDescription::hasCue and Studio::EventInstance::triggerCue.
* Studio API   - Deprecated Studio::EventInstance::getParameter and 
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterByIndex.  Instead use 
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValue,
                 Studio::EventInstance::setParameterValue,
                 Studio::EventInstance::getParameterValueByIndex, and

                 playing late if the sample data has not been preloaded.
* Core API     - System::getChannelsPlaying now returns the number of real and
                 total channels playing.  System::getChannelsReal has been 
                 removed.
* FSBank       - AT9 compression now requires AT9 library 1.7.1 (DLL version 2.8.0.5)
                 or later. Compression in 32bit versions of FSBank is no longer supported 
                 in line with Sony's removal of 32bit compression libraries.

                 parameters to an effect no longer breaks bank version
                 compatibility.
* Studio API   - Studio::Bank::getEventCount and Studio::Bank::getEventList only
                 return events directly added to the bank, not implicit events
                 that are included in the bank due to event instrument references.
* Studio API   - The asynchronous command buffer for the Studio API will now
                 grow as necessary, avoiding stalls that could occur if it was too

                 earlier.
* Core API     - PS4 - Changed default mix buffer size to 512 samples to reduce
                       CPU cost. Previous setting of 256 can be set using
                       System::setDSPBufferSize.
* Core API     - PS4 - The size of each pre-allocated AT9 instance has increased
                       by 8kB.

* Studio API   - Deprecated Studio::ID typedef. Please use FMOD_GUID type.
* Studio API   - Changed FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TYPE from an enum to a
                 bitfield. Added 'callbackmask' parameter to
                 Studio::EventDescription::setCallback and
                 Studio::EventInstance::setCallback.

* Core API     - PS3 - Fixed FMOD_PS3_INITFLAGS overlapping FMOD_INITFLAGS causing
                       certain FMOD_INITFLAGS to affect PS3 specific bit-stream
                       encoding options.

----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Studio API   - Studio::MixerStrip has been replaced by Studio::Bus and Studio::VCA.
                 The new classes do not have a release method, as their handles
                 remain valid until the bank containing them is unloaded.
* Studio API   - Studio::System::getEvent, Studio::System::getBus, Studio::System::getVCA,
                 and Studio::System::getBank now take a string path.
                 Functions that take an ID are now named Studio::System::getEventByID,
                 Studio::System::getBusByID, Studio::System::getVCAByID, and
                 Studio::System::getBankByID.
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::release no longer invalidates the
                 handle immediately. The handle remains valid until the event
                 stops and is actually destroyed. In addition, this function
                 now succeeds even if the event will not stop naturally.
* Studio API   - Events with sounds triggered by parameters will now stop rather
                 than going idle when all sounds have finished and the timeline
                 cursor has reached the end.
* Core API     - The wide string argument of System::getDriverInfo() and
                 System::getRecordDriverInfo() has been removed. These functions
                 now return UTF-8 encoded strings.
* Core API     - FMOD_UNICODE flag for System::createSound() and System::createStream()
                 has been removed. These functions now accept UTF-8 encoded file names
                 to load sounds with non-ASCII characters on Windows, PS3, PS4, PS Vita,
                 XBox One, iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, Windows Phone, and Windows Store.
* FSBank API   - FSBANK_INIT_UNICODE flag has been removed. All file name structure
                 members and function arguments now accept UTF-8 encoded strings.

Features:
* Studio API   - Added FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_PLUGIN_CREATED and
                 FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_PLUGIN_DESTROYED callback types.

* Core API     - Added FMOD::Debug_Initialize to configure the destination and
                 level of debug logging when using the logging version of FMOD.
                 This is a more flexible replacement for the previous
                 FMOD::Debug_SetLevel API.
* Core API     - Android - Added support for playing AAC files (requires Android 4.2).
* Core API     - Android - Reduced latency for devices that support FastMixer, see
                           "Basic Information" section of the docs CHM for details.
* Core API     - Added DSP::setWetDryMix so any effect can have generic wet/dry
                 signal level control.
* Core API     - Added 3D ChannelGroup support.  A ChannelGroup is a 'group bus'
                 and it can now be positioned in 3d space, affecting the mix for
                 buses and channels below it.  3D Cones, geometry etc all work.
                 Use ChannelGroup::setMode(FMOD_3D) to enable a 3D ChannelGroup.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed transitions to the end of a loop region failing to escape
                 the loop.
* Studio API   - Fixed sends inside events occasionally having a brief period
                 of full volume when the event is started.

                 event to prevent incorrect ramping. This relies on
                 FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK leaving public parameters unchanged.
* Studio API   - Studio::System::getEvent's unimplemented mode parameter has
                 been removed, along with FMOD_STUDIO_LOADING_MODE.
* Studio API   - FMOD_STUDIO_PLAYBACK_IDLE and FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_IDLE
                 have been removed.
* Studio API   - Removed deprecated function Studio::EventInstance::createSubEvent.
* Core API     - Changed FMOD_FILE_ASYNCCANCEL_CALLBACK to take FMOD_ASYNCREADINFO
                 structure rather than void *handle.
* Core API     - The FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK documentation has been updated to
                 make it clear that it should leave public parameters unchanged.
* Core API     - PS4 - Thread affinity can now be set as a mask of allowed cores.
* Core API     - iOS / Mac - Reduced default block size to 512 for lower latency.
* Core API     - Android - Renamed Java interface from FMODAudioDevice to simply
                           FMOD, i.e. org.fmod.FMOD.init().
* Core API     - Channel::setMode moved to ChannelControl::setMode so that
                 ChannelGroups can now also have 2D/3D mode bits set.

* Core API     - If a user DSP is added after the master ChannelGroup's fader that
                 changes the output channel count to something other than the
                 software mixer's channel count, stuttering could occur.  Fixed.
* Studio API   - Windows - Fixed Studio API functions deadlocking when in
                 asynchronous mode and a sound device is removed.
* Core API     - PS3 - Fixed some DSP parameter sets being ignored
                 (overwritten by SPU DMA)
