Simple Music Player
===================

This is the next version of simple music player ([SimpleMP](http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/))

*Use it with your own risk!*

SimpleMP or Simple Music Player is a simple and easy to use music player for free. It plays the most common music files (mp3, ogg, wma, wav) in a simple way.

Why another music player? When I decided to make my first player back in 2005, the Winamp 3 player was to buggy and very slow! I stopped developing in 2007.
I used my favorite programming language Delphi 5 and I learned a lot of  new stuff. It was a great time and a few people in the Delphi community honoured my work :-)
Unfortunately, the interface of the FMOD sound library was no longer supported for Delphi and I decided to stop working on it.

After long time, now it's time to make a new one!

It's not perfect and many function not yet implemented.

First simple functions
======================

+ Drag&Drop your files or directories into the player (on the play list)
+ Plays mp3, ogg, wma and wav files
+ Shortcut keys if the player is on top and has the focus
	+ [Space] play or pause current file (if none is playing, the first selected file starts)
	+ [Enter] play selected files
	+ [j] play next file
	+ [k] play previuos file
	+ [s] shuffle mode on / off
	+ [r] repeat current file on / off
+ Simple Equalizer
